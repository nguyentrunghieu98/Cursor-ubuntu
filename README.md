## 2.2 (Current) 
**Add figlet Library for User-Friendly Terminal Display:**

To enhance the user experience, the script now uses the `figlet` library to display banners and ASCII art in the terminal. This makes the installation and update process more visually friendly and engaging.

- The script will automatically check and install `figlet` if it is not already present on your system.
- Banners such as "Cursor AI IDE" and a cat ASCII art will be shown at the start of the script for a more welcoming interface.

**Example output:**
```
   ______                              ____   ____   ________  ______
  / ____/_  ________________  _____   /   |  /  _/  /  _/ __ \/ ____/

```

This helps users quickly recognize the script's purpose and provides a more pleasant terminal experience.

### 2.1 
- **Ubuntu Version Check:** The script now checks if your system is running Ubuntu 22.04. If not, it will prompt you to use the appropriate installer for your Ubuntu version (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04).
- **Automatic libfuse2 Installation:** The script will automatically check for and install `libfuse2` if it is missing, ensuring AppImage compatibility on Ubuntu 22.04. Since the Ubuntu Version Check is already implemented above, this automatic installation is safe and will not cause issues on other Ubuntu versions.

### 2.0 
- **Automatic Download:** Script can auto-fetch and download the latest Cursor AppImage from the official website.
- **Manual Path Option:** Option to specify a local AppImage file path if preferred or if auto-download fails.
- **Icon Selection:** User can choose the application icon during setup.
- **Easy Update:** The same options are available for updating Cursor to the latest version.
- **Improved User Prompts:** Clear error messages and fallback options for a smoother experience.

### 1.0 (Initial Release)
- Basic installation and update of Cursor AppImage via manual file path only.
- Icon selection during installation.
- Creation of desktop entry for easy launching.

- For the best experience, restart your computer after installation.
- The script requires sudo privileges to create files in system directories.

## 🚀 Installation/Update Steps

1.  **Download the Management Script**

        * You will be asked how to provide the Cursor AppImage:
            * **Option 1 (Recommended):** Auto-download the latest Cursor AppImage from the official website. The script will attempt to fetch and download the newest version automatically.
                * If auto-download fails, you will see a clear error message and be prompted to enter the local file path manually.
            * **Option 2:** Specify the local file path to a previously downloaded Cursor AppImage on your computer.
        * You will also be prompted to enter the icon filename (e.g., `cursor-icon.png` or `cursor-black-icon.png`).

3.  **Run the Script**
    * Run the script:
        ```zsh
        ./scripts/manage_cursor.sh
        ```
    * The script will present a menu:
        * Choose '1' to **Install Cursor**.
        * Choose '2' to **Update Cursor**.

4.  **Launch Cursor**
    * After restarting, you should find "Cursor AI IDE" in your application menu.
    * Alternatively, you can launch it from the terminal:

## 🛠️ Script Functionality
The script will:
-   Offer to install or update Cursor.
-   **During Installation:**
    -   Check for and install `curl` if missing.
    -   Check for and install `libfuse2` if missing (important for running AppImages).
    -   Move the specified Cursor AppImage to `/opt/Cursor/cursor.AppImage`.
    -   Make the AppImage executable.
    -   Download a chosen icon to `/opt/Cursor/cursor-icon.png`.
    -   Create a desktop entry (`/usr/share/applications/cursor.desktop`) for easy access.
-   **During Update:**
    -   Download the new Cursor AppImage, replacing the old one in `/opt/Cursor/`.
    -   Ensure the new AppImage is executable.

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1.  Ensure you have `sudo` privileges and an active internet connection.
2.  Verify that the AppImage download path you provided is correct and accessible.
3.  Confirm the icon filename exists in the `images` directory of the `hieutt192/Cursor-ubuntu` GitHub repository.
4.  If Cursor fails to start after installation, ensure `libfuse2` was installed correctly. The script attempts this, but you can manually check/install with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libfuse2`.
5.  Check script permissions (`chmod +x your_script_name.sh`).
